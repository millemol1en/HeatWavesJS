          <p>
            The origins of the art works inspiration goes back to 1967, where the young astrophysist Jocelyn Bell from the University of Cambridge, 
            detected pulsars radio waves from a neutron star. Over 978.5 light years away, the electromagnetic radiation emitted from its poles
            was recorded and with successive 1.337 second intervals between each pulse, the pulsars were stacked on top of each other to
            create one of the worlds first scientific data visualization. Jocelyn would later name her work the very scientific name "PSR b1919+21".

          <h2>Joy Division - Unknown Pleasure</h2>
          <p>
            After having seen it in the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Astronomy, the post-punk band known as Joy Division, would use it for their debut album Unknown Pleasures, released in 1979. 
            The album's skyrocketing success had a huge impact not only for the band but also for the album's cover, making it become synonymous with youthful rebelliousness, post-modernistic art and revolutionary technology. 
            The art itself would later invoke Joy Division to create the song, "Transmissions" in 1979, after the release of Unknown Pleasures.

            Our piece, "60ºS-60ºN, 0º-360ºE," connects with Jocelyn's work not only through their shared 
            cryptic titles but also because both are deeply rooted in scientific data, focusing on areas 
            and aspects defined by nature. With regards to Joy Division, their use of it as an album cover
            in 1979 propelled it into international light, making it a representation of youthful rebelliousness and where Climate Change is often lead by the young, this links the 2

            Taking inspiration from these 2 stories and what they each represent, our project aims to 
            offer a fresh perspective on the data that has been represented as a line graph one million times over.

            The creative visualization takes on 2 different views. The first is the the main artistic piece as a single stand-alone element.
            The second being the raw data as a series of stacked lines, all of which are interactive and able to display key
            information.
