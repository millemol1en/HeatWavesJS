# History of CP 1919 / PSR B1919+21 
In 1967, pulsar radio waves were detected by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnell from the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observerty in Cambridge.
These pulsars came from CP 1919, a neutron star over 978.5 light years away emitting electromagnetic radiation from its poles. 

With pulsars consistently arriving at Earth every 1.337 seconds, Jocelyn and her team stacked up each pulsar to highlight the irregularities. 
This simple design would ultimately have a profound impact on both the scientific and music industry as it become the album cover for Joy
Divisions debut album - Unknown Pleasures.
