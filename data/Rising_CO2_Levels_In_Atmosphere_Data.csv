"Note that GCP gives emissions in MtCO2, rather than MtC. For consistency with CDIAC's global.1751_2014.ems",,,,,,,,
"spreadsheet, I converted to MtC by multipling GCP's figures by (12.0107 / 44.0095).",,,,,,,,

GCP figures average somewhat higher than the BP figures.,,,,,,,,

The enormous precision with which the numbers are given does not imply that they are known that precisely.,,,,,,,,
My guess is that most of them are known to within about +/- 10% (but that's just a guess).,,,,,,,,
